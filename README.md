let us try and explore the data given for House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques.

Objective:

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, we will predict the final price of each home.

A Comprehensive Checklist for Solving Any Regression Problem:

Data Fetching
Understanding the Data
Checking the Skwewness of the Output Variable
Performing Log Transformation (if required)
Exploratory Data Analysis
Analysing Correlation
Finding out Important Predictors
Feature Engineering: -
Missing Values
Outliers
Categorical Feature Encoding
Creating Folds and Defining Fold Map
Defining Models
Fitting the Model and Running Cross Validation
Stacking and Ensembling
Hyperparameter Optimization

The above mentioned checklist is very importnant for solving any regression based problem. 

In this project we start code from Demo.ipynb inturn use custom packages and modules using pure python libraries.
